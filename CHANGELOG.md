## [v0.3.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Full-Lifecycle Examples**: Added comprehensive examples for both Go SDK (`full_sdk`) and WebSocket protocol (`full_websocket`), covering cold starts, hot-multiplexing, and session recovery.
- **Process Robustness**: Implemented `shutdownOnce` and enhanced `SIGKILL` logic to ensure clean termination of process groups (PGID).
- **GitHub Integration**: Official repository initialization and CI-ready structure.

### Changed
- **Documentation Overhaul**: Synchronized `architecture.md`, `README.md`, and `README_zh.md` to reflect the v0.2.0+ security posture (Native Tool Constraints).
- **WAF Refinement**: Updated `danger.go` to support context-aware interception and improved logging for security forensics.
- **Session Recovery**: Enhanced deterministic UUID v5 mapping to support seamless session resumption across engine restarts.

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-02-20

### Changed
- **Security Posture Pivot**: Removed `ForbiddenPaths`, `GlobalAllowedPaths`, and `SessionAllowedPaths` from the SDK. Since HotPlex wraps a native binary (Claude CLI), it cannot reliably intercept raw OS syscalls mid-flight.
- **Native Tool Constraints**: Replaced path restrictions with native `--allowed-tools` and `--disallowed-tools` configurations.
- **Engine-Level Exclusivity**: Tool capabilities (`AllowedTools` / `DisallowedTools`) are now strictly defined on the `hotplex.EngineOptions` struct. `Config` no longer holds any capability boundaries, enforcing a single source of truth for Sandboxing.

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Core Engine**: Implemented `hotplex.Engine` singleton for routing and process multiplexing.
- **Session Manager**: `SessionPool` functionality to manage long-lived OS processes with deterministic UUID mapping for Hot-Multiplexing.
- **WebSocket Gateway**: Standalone `hotplexd` server supporting persistent bi-directional streams over `ws://`.
- **Pre-flight Sandbox**: Introduced regex-based WAF (`danger.go`) to inherently block destructive shell commands (`rm -rf`, network shells, etc).
- **Security Boundaries**: Global static boundaries vs Per-session dynamic contexts cleanly separated between `EngineOptions` and `Config`.
- **Example Projects**: Provided Go native integration examples (`basic_sdk`) and pure JavaScript UI examples (`websocket_client`).

### Changed
- Refactored `Config` API: Migrated `Mode`, `PermissionMode`, `ForbiddenPaths` to global `EngineOptions` to prevent sandbox escape via API abuse.
- Streamlined Session identification to accept completely arbitrary context strings globally without breaking UUID persistence constraints.
