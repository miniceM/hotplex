# Contributing to hotplex

First off, thank you for considering contributing to hotplex! It's people like you that make hotplex such a great tool.

Our **First Principle** is to leverage and bridge existing elite AI CLI tools (like Claude Code) into the production ecosystem. Contributions should align with this vision of building a "Control Plane" rather than reinventing the agent's core reasoning or tool logic.

**CRITICAL**: Contributors must read and adhere to [AGENT.md](AGENT.md) for architectural boundaries, concurrency safety, and process lifecycle rules.

## 🚀 How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/hrygo/hotplex/issues) page to see if the bug has already been reported.
- If not, create a new issue using the **Bug Report** template.
- Include as much detail as possible: steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.

### Suggesting Enhancements
- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/hrygo/hotplex/issues) page to see if your idea has already been suggested.
- If not, create a new issue using the **Feature Request** template.

### Pull Requests
1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes (`go test ./...`).
5. Make sure your code follows the Go standard formatting (`go fmt ./...`).
6. Issue that pull request!

## 🛠 Development Setup

1. Install Go 1.24 or later.
2. Install Required AI CLI tools (e.g., `Claude Code` or `OpenCode`).
3. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/HotPlex.git`.

### Useful Commands
We use a `Makefile` to standardize development workflows:
- `make build`: Compiles the `hotplexd` binary to `dist/`.
- `make test`: Runs unit tests.
- `make lint`: Runs `golangci-lint` to ensure code quality.
- `make run`: Builds and starts the daemon locally.

### Documentation Policy
We follow a **"Docs-First"** mentality for releases. Any PR modifying public APIs or core behavior *must* update the relevant documentation in `docs/` and the README files.
